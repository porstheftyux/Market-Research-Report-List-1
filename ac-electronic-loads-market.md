<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Electronic Loads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Loads</li><li>Non-Linear Loads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC electronic loads market is categorized into linear and non-linear loads. Linear loads, such as resistive heating elements and incandescent lights, maintain a constant current during operation, resulting in a predictable voltage-to-current relationship. In contrast, non-linear loads, like computers and LED lighting, draw varying currents, causing distortion in the electrical waveform and leading to harmonics. This distinction impacts energy efficiency, system design, and power quality, making it essential for industries to address specific requirements of each load type.</p></p>
